# Token Cost + Fit Checker — Charter

This document records the builder's full calibration run: the pinned sample, traffic context, stakes, deadline, dial scores, verdict, flip condition, and the demanded test.

---

## Pinned Sample

**Verbatim bytes:**

> "Ihr Krankenversicherungsbeitrag wurde angepasst — bitte prüfen Sie die Beitragsbemessungsgrenze." / "Sigortalılığınızın başlangıç tarihini öğrenebilir miyim?" (two verbatim tickets from the queue)

---

## Traffic Source

14-day support queue export: 38% German, 22% Turkish, 19% English, remainder Thai / Arabic / Mandarin

---

## What This Decides

Picks the vocabulary for the on-device assistant — the embedding table is capped and inference is billed per token

---

## Decision Deadline

Thursday's architecture review

---

## Split Observation

I dont see any english reference even though it claims 19% english

---

## Cost Observation

I dont know I am not a language translator

---

## Five Dial Scores

| Dial | Score (0–4) |
|------|-------------|
| special_token_handling | 2 |
| vocabulary_fit | 2 |
| merge_economy | 2 |
| how_it_splits | 2 |
| edge_case_survival | 2 |

**Weakest Dial:** vocabulary_fit

---

## Verdict

The vocabulary accuracy metrics should be more than 90% accurate for it to be acceptable.

---

## Flip Condition

If the vocabulary accuracy metrics is lower than 60%, it would be unacceptable.

---

## Demanded Test

Run 100 samples and it meets the bare min 90% accuracy.
